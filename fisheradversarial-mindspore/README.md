# Detect adversarial examples using the Fisher information

This implements a method for the detection of adversarial examples based on the Fisher information, presented in the Neurocomputing article *Inspecting adversarial examples using the fisher information* [1]. There is also a (slightly less elaborated) arXiv preprint available [2]. 

## Installation
You need to have [mindspore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/) installed in your virtual environment, in order to run this software.


## Usage

**Note**: The method is currently designed for inputs `x` of batch size 1. That is, it is assumed that `x.shape[0] == 1`.

The main file of this package is the module `fisherform`:
```
import mindspore 
import mindspore.nn as ms_nn
import mindspore.ops as ops
import fisherform
import fishertrace
```
There is also a module `fishertrace` contained in the package that implements adversarial detection based on the trace of the Fisher information matrix, as explained in [1]. To check that the software works you might want to pick some random objects:
```
ms_net = ms_nn.SequentialCell(ms_nn.Dense(10,5),ms_nn.Tanh(),ms_nn.Dense(5,3),ms_nn.LogSoftmax(axis=1))
ms_x = ops.randn((1,10))

```
For a (trained) pytorch model `ms_net` with log-softmax output and an input `ms_x` with batch size 1, first compute a corresponding direction `v`. For instance, as explained in [1], you can take the gradient of the maximal output node, that is
```
def forward(ms_x):
    return ms_net(ms_x).max()
grad_fn = mindspore.value_and_grad(forward,has_aux=False)
ms_out = ms_net(ms_x).max()
output, inputs_gradient = grad_fn(ms_x)
ms_v = []
for ms_par in ms_net.get_parameters():
    ms_v.append(ms_par.value().copy())
```
Computing the fisher form from [1] for adversarial detection can then be achieved via
```
fisherform.numeric_fisher_form(ms_x, ms_net, ms_v)
```
This 0 dimensional tensor measures how *unusual* the input is, compared to the learned parameters of `ms_net`. If you are using a trained network, and not a random one as above, this number will go up once you feed adversarial inputs `ms_x`. 

The second quantity introduced in [1] is the Fisher information sensitivity (FIS). The FIS measures, loosely speaking, the contribution of the input nodes to the unusualness and will thus have the same dimensionality as the input `ms_x`. To compute it type
```
fisherform.fisher_information_sensitivity(ms_x, ms_net, ms_v) 
```
If you used the random net from above, then these numbers will probably be all of a similar magnitude. If you are using a trained network, and images as input, than you might plot the FIS - compare [1] for images.
